# Welcome to My New Professional Website

I'm excited to launch my redesigned professional website, marking a transition from my previous academic-focused platform to one that better reflects my current career in biotechnology and process development engineering.

## Why the Change?

After several years in academia and research, I've transitioned into a professional biotech career as a Senior Process Development Engineer at [Curio Bioscience](https://curiobioscience.com). This role focuses on:

- Scaling manufacturing processes for spatial biology platforms
- Developing automation solutions for biotechnology applications  
- Bridging research-scale innovations with production-ready systems

The new website design reflects this professional focus while still showcasing my technical background and research experience.

## Technical Migration

The site has been rebuilt from the ground up using modern web technologies:

### Previous Stack (Academic Focus)
- **Hugo** static site generator with Academic theme
- **R/RStudio** with blogdown for content creation
- Academic-centric layout with emphasis on publications and research

### New Stack (Professional Focus)
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript for modern, performant web application
- **Tailwind CSS** for professional, responsive design
- **MDX** for technical blog posts with rich content capabilities
- **Netlify** for deployment (maintaining familiar hosting)

## Featured Projects

The new site prominently features technical projects that demonstrate engineering problem-solving, including:

- **[Caltrain Performance Tracker](/projects/caltrain-tracker)** - A real-time transit analytics platform
- Process development case studies from biotech work
- Automation and data visualization projects

## What's Coming

I plan to use the blog section for:

- Technical insights on biotech process development
- Engineering problem-solving approaches
- Industry trends in spatial biology and manufacturing
- Project deep-dives and case studies

## Maintaining Research Legacy

While the focus has shifted professional, I've preserved access to my research publications and academic work in a streamlined format. The **[Publications](/publications)** section maintains links to peer-reviewed work while not being the primary focus.
