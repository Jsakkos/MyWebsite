abstract: Biodegradation by cells encapsulated in silica gel is an economical and environmentally friendly methodfor the removal of toxic chemicals from the environment. In this work, recombinantE. coliexpressingatrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA) were encapsulated in organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) gels com-posed of TEOS, silica nanoparticles (SNPs), and either phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) or methyltriethoxysi-lane (MTES). ORMOSIL gels adsorbed much higher amounts of atrazine than the hydrophilic TEOS gels.The highest amount of atrazine adsorbed by ORMOSIL gels was 48.91 x 10^-3 mol/ml gel, compared to 8.71 x 10^-3 mol/ml gel by the hydrophilic TEOS gels. Atrazine biodegradation rates were also higherin ORMOSIL gels than the TEOS gels, mainly due to co-localization of the hydrophobic substrate at highconcentrations in close proximity of the encapsulated bacteria. A direct correlation between atrazineadsorption and biodegradation was observed unless biodegradation decreased due to severe phase sep-aration. The optimized PTES and MTES gels had atrazine biodegradation rates of 0:0410:003 and0:0470:004lmol/ml gel, respectively. These rates were approximately 80% higher than that measuredin the TEOS gel. This study showed for the first time that optimized hydrophobic gel material design canbe used to enhance both removal and biodegradation of hydrophobic chemicals.
