abstract: Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is a model cyanobacterium for study
  of the circadian clock, photosynthesis, and bioproduction of chemicals, yet
  nearly 40% of its gene identities and functions remain unknown, in part due to
  limitations of the existing genetic toolkit. While classical techniques for
  the study of genes (e.g., deletion or mutagenesis) can yield valuable
  information about the absence of a gene and its associated protein,there are
  limits to these approaches, particularly in the study of essential genes.
  Herein, we developed a tool for inducibledegradation of target proteins in S.
  elongatus by adapting a method using degron tags from the Mesoplasma florum
  transfer-mRNA (tmRNA) system. We observed that M. florum lon protease can
  rapidly degrade exogenous and native proteins tagged with the cognate sequence
  within hours of induction. We used this system to inducibly degrade the
  essential cell division factor, FtsZ, as well as shell protein components of
  the carboxysome. Our results have implications for carboxysome biogenesis and
  the rate of carboxysome turnover during cell growth. Lon protease control of
  proteins offers an alternative approach for the study of essential proteins
  and protein dynamics in cyanobacteria.
