abstract: Enzymes of natural biochemical pathways are routinely subcellularly
  organized in space and time in order to improve pathway efficacy and control.
  Designer scaffolding platforms are under development to confer similar
  benefits upon engineered pathways. Herein, we evaluate bacterial
  microcompartment shell (pfam0936-domain) proteins as modules for constructing
  well-defined nanometer scale scaffolds in vivo. We use a suite of
  visualization techniques to evaluate scaffold assembly and dynamics. We
  demonstrate recruitment of target cargo molecules onto assembled scaffolds by
  appending reciprocally interacting adaptor domains. These interactions can be
  refined by fine-tuning the scaffold expression level. Real-time observation of
  this system reveals a nucleation-limited step where multiple scaffolds
  initially form within a cell. Over time, nucleated scaffolds reorganize into a
  single intracellular assembly, likely due to interscaffold competition for
  protein subunits. Our results suggest design considerations for using
  self-assembling proteins as building blocks to construct nanoscaffolds, while
  also providing a platform to visualize scaffold-cargo dynamics in vivo.
