&lt;p>Deeply anesthetized and comatose states are often accompanied by a distinctive pattern of
electroencephalographic activity called &lt;strong>Burst Suppression&lt;/strong> (BS). This pattern’s underlying mechanism and
functional significance remain largely unknown. I explore how BS manifests itself in fMRI data
obtained from from both humans and animals (non-human primates, rats).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RheMAP</title><link>/project/rhemap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/rhemap/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The RheMAP project provides access to a set of pre-calculated non-linear registrations between some of the most commonly used rhesus macaque brain templates (D99, INIA19, MNI macaque, NMT, Yerkes19). The &lt;a href="https://github.com/PRIME-RE/RheMAP">repository&lt;/a> contains the code used to calculate the registration warps and example code that demonstrates how to use the resulting warp files to remap data between different template spaces. Non-linear registration warps were generated using &lt;a href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">ANTs&lt;/a> and can directly be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3668510">Zenodo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Medetomidine has become a popular choice for anesthetizing rats during long-lasting sessions of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Despite this, it has not yet been thoroughly established how commonly reported fMRI readouts evolve over several hours of medetomidine anesthesia and how they are affected by the precise timing, dose, and route of administration. We used four different protocols of medetomidine administration to anesthetize rats for up to six hours and repeatedly evaluated somatosensory stimulus-evoked BOLD responses and resting state functional connectivity. We found that the temporal evolution of fMRI readouts strongly depended on the method of administration. Intravenous administration of a medetomidine bolus (0.05 mg/kg), combined with a subsequent continuous infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h), led to temporally stable measures of stimulus-evoked activity and functional connectivity throughout the anesthesia. Deviating from the above protocol—by omitting the bolus, lowering the medetomidine dose, or using the subcutaneous route—compromised the stability of these measures in the initial two-hour period. We conclude that both an appropriate protocol of medetomidine administration and a suitable timing of fMRI experiments are crucial for obtaining consistent results. These factors should be considered for the design and interpretation of future rat fMRI studies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PyRat fMRI</title><link>/project/pyrat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/pyrat/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>PyRat_fMRI can get you from a 4D NIFTI file to an activation map in under 1 minute. It is meant for a quick inspection of activation maps, &lt;strong>NOT&lt;/strong> for formal analysis.

&lt;p>The preprocessing and analysis of nonhuman primate (NHP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data presents some unique challenges. Over the years, many laboratories and researchers have created their own custom solutions to many of these problems. PRIME-RE aims to provide an overview of the main difficulties and curate a collection of solutions that currently exist within the broader NHP-MRI community for specific processing steps that are commonly performed on NHP MRI data. Since this is a community effort, we strongly encourage you to contribute your workflows and pipelines. PRIME-RE is maintained by members of the &lt;a href="http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html">PRIME-DE consortium&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summa cum Liesel</title><link>/project/scl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/scl/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-the-blog">About the blog&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Summa cum Liesel is a blog for sharing PhD experiences, advice, and of course – science. The blog is mostly aimed at Life Sciences PhDs living or studying in Göttingen. However, most of the content is applicable to any PhD student in Germany, in the world, or anyone interested in biology for that matter. The goal is to make a platform for students to communicate freely and openly about any topic related to PhD life. This includes showcasing our science, sharing practical knowledge and expertise we have accumulated (including the difficulties), and also – just getting to know each other better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re a student, alumnus, post-academic professional, or someone else interesting, and you want to try your hand at writing a post – contact us at &lt;strong>&lt;a href="mailto:contact@summacumliesel.com">contact@summacumliesel.com&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t be discouraged by lack of writing experience. It doesn’t need to be (and shouldn’t be) anything fancy! Just a short –max 1500 words– conversion of thoughts to text. There’s also editing included.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Neurizons is a multidisciplinary neuroscience conference organized by the students of the &lt;a href="https://www.gpneuro.uni-goettingen.de/">International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neurosciences&lt;/a>, in Göttingen. I have been part of the organizing committee since 2017 and have mainly taken care of the conference&amp;rsquo;s graphic design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neurizons 2020 took place online, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. I took part in migrating the conference into a virtual platform - &lt;a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/">crowdcast&lt;/a>. You can read about my main take-aways from this experience in this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niksirbi/status/1280875270510125056">twitter thread&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
